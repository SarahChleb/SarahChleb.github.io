      <description> Static Sites:  collection of static web pages hard coded: the pages do not change, everybody gets the same page Cheap Fast Easy development Scalable Secure Version control of content: You can follow the changes of the content and the editor who changed and when it was done!  Dynamic sites:  dynamically generated More functions Easy management (CMS) Customized content Database storage (MySQL, Oracleâ€¦ are not ideal for storing content) Only single upload Realtime updates (very important for E-commerce) slower - every webpage is built up on demand expensive  </description>

      <description>Static Website Generator (SWG) A Static Website Generator (SWG) is an item that helps building websites with little or no changes over time - so static websites. Before the SWGs came up static websites were generated by backend HTML programming. A dynamic website needs a CMS to be operated. SWGs try to combine the advantages of backend programming and CMS: Content creation via simple markup (often Markdown), no need to dig into HTML Separation of content and style(s) Support for well structured (textual) content</description>
